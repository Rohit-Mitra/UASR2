# UASR2

This is a repo for the round 2 of software department UAS DTU

Contents: 

There are 3 sections here, two of them are the task given and one is the practice code I did while learning the basics of Python and OpenCV python.

TASK 1:
The task for you is to build a stitched image from a given sequence of provided images
(around 10) into a seamless mosaic.


TASK 2:   
To simplify the task we need you to build a software system which detects a RED arrow in a
video feed captured by the web camera and prints the angle of its heading with respect to
the vertical axis of the image. The system should work in varying backgrounds and varying
lighting conditions. We will give you a step-by-step approach to do the same.
